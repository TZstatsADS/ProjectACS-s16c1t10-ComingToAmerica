#From this graph, we can see that the people who is nonnative combines a bell share carve which 45 years old people have the largest
#number. Amomg them, non-native immigrants who think they speak english very well contains the most part. People who think them speak well
#or not well are basicly same and slightly little than the people who think themselves are very well. The non-native immigrants who cannot
#speak english has the least people, which we may can conclude that immigrants who cannot speak English may suffer a hard life in US
#or in only can live in some particular area.

# In this graph, we can see the education level and the age in 100% scale. We can see with the age goes up, non-native immigrants's 
#degree level begins to decrease, especially for the college level. As a result, we can see the nonnative's education
#level is increasing as the age goes down, which means the younger people will trend to have a higher degree. Besides, 
#Phd degree is the hardest one to achive which is based on this graph.

#From this graph, we can see the employment of the nonnative people. Among the mid-aged people, there are around 20%
#non-native immigrants are not in labor force, and among the 80% people who are labor force, about 10% people are unemployed which is
# far high than the unemployment rate of US in 2013 which is around 7%. We can draw a conclusion that the non-native immigrants
#have a harder condition to work than native citizens.

#Based on this graph, we can easily see that people who have higher education level, they will have a higher chance to
# be employed. The unployment rate of people who just have a bachelor degree or lower is much higher than the non-native immigrants 
#who have a graduate school degree. As a result, being a nonnative people, one should go for a higher degree as much as
#possible. Besides, another interesting thing is the non-native immigrants who has higher degree will have a lower not in labor force 
#rate.
