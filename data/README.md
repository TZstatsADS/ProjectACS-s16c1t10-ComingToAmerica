# Project: American Community Survey
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

jmd2228: testing git
zw2327: for file ss13husa30.csv, this file contains the first 30 lines of file ss13husa.csv, created by "head -10 $origin  > $target ". As I realized the orginal file is to big to open, this file could be good for test use.
